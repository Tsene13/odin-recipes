<p>Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup of Butter</li>
    <li>1,5 cups of Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of <strong>minced</strong> garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian Herbs</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups of freshly grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to make the Alfredo Sauce</h2>

<ol>
    <li>The first step to making Alfredo is to warm your butter and cream in a large saucepan over low heat.  You will let it simmer (but not boil) for about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Next, you will whisk in your garlic and seasonings.  Whisking constantly for about one minute just to let the garlic cook.</li>
    <li>Lastly, you will add your parmesan cheese and stir just until the cheese has melted and your sauce is smooth.</li>
</ol>
<em>Note that it is best to use freshly grated parmesan cheese right off of the block so that your sauce isn't grainy.  I do not recommend using the "shaker" style container grated cheese for this recipe.</em>
